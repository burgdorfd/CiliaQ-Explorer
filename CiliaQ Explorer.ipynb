    "This notebook provides a step-by-step pipeline that can process CiliaQ-derived analysis results from different replicates and experimental conditions. It allows pooling of CiliaQ-derived _.CQ_ files from different experimental replicates and conditions, performing quality control and statistical analysis of the data, and plotting all ciliary parameters in a superplot format.   \n",

Make sure that the _CQ.txt_ files do not contain any inserted or deleted cells, rows or columns, as this may lead to errors during the analysis. For reliable analysis, ensure that the _CQ.txt_ files are stored locally on the device. \n",

The pipeline both transforms the data linearly (Principle Component Analysis, PCA) and non-linearly (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, UMAP). Additionally, CiliaQ Explorer performs Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to identify measurements that strongly vary across experimental groups. Parameters that substantially contribute to class separation are worth investigating deeper, as they might be altered under different experimental conditions.  "

Specifically, the software screens for outliers regarding ciliary length, volume, maximum span, average cilia marker intensity and standard deviation, as well as the number of branches.  Cilia that are identified by the Quality Control pipeline are worth being re-validated for high quality segmentation. However, please note that QC outputs are limited and do not necessarily prove high-or low quality analysis. For further information, please refer to our protocol publication."
